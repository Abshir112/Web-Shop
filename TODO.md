# Assignment: Web Shop for Computer Books (HTML & CSS Only)
Technologies to Use:

HTML
CSS
Assignment Details:

Create a Web Shop/Online Store: The store will sell computer books focused on frontend development.

# Book Data Representation:

# Create a simple HTML structure to represent book data.
Make sure to use semantic HTML tags.
Include placeholders for book details where data would dynamically load if JS were used. Ex. page numbers, author etc.
# Categories: Represent categories like ‘UX’, ‘HTML’, ‘CSS’, and ‘JavaScript’. Each category can be a section in your HTML.

# Book Titles:

Include at least 6 book titles across all categories.
Write a 50-word summary in your own words for these specific titles (this can be generated).
Use ‘Lorem Ipsum’ text for the book description if you don't want to generate it.
Filtering and Sorting:

# Make the layout look the same as Step 3 Categories
Without JavaScript, real filtering and sorting are not feasible.
Create separate sections or categories for different filters as a static showcase (e.g., books sorted by price, books by authors, etc.).
This will be a demonstration of what the filtering/sorting would look like.
Buy Button:

# Place a static 'Buy' button next to each book.
Note: This button will not have functionality in the absence of JavaScript.
Images for Each Book:

These can be placeholders or relevant images.
These images should through code be made the same size.
Make sure to have appropriate accessibility tags
Shopping Cart:

# Design a shopping cart section.
Make sure to use semantic HTML tags.
This will be a static representation without dynamic add/remove functionality.
Include 2 Items in the cart
Each cart item should include:
Title
Book Cover
Price
Small "x" for delete from cart (no functionality)
